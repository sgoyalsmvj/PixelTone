# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Creative Studio is a collaborative digital platform that enables users to generate, customize, and share AI-generated art and music through natural language descriptions. The platform provides real-time creative output with interactive controls, community features, and export capabilities for seamless integration into creative workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Natural Language Creative Input

**User Story:** As a creative user, I want to describe my artistic vision in natural language, so that I can generate art and music without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters text describing visual elements (colors, style, mood, themes) THEN the system SHALL parse the input into structured visual parameters
2. WHEN a user enters text describing audio elements (instruments, tempo, mood, genre) THEN the system SHALL parse the input into structured audio parameters
3. WHEN a user provides voice input THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text and process it as natural language input
4. IF the input contains ambiguous terms THEN the system SHALL provide clarification options or use default interpretations
5. WHEN parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL display the interpreted parameters for user confirmation

### Requirement 2: Real-Time Creative Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my creative ideas come to life instantly, so that I can iterate quickly on my artistic vision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN valid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL generate visual content within 2 seconds
2. WHEN valid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL generate audio content within 2 seconds
3. WHEN generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator with progress feedback
4. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL display the visual output in a canvas component
5. WHEN audio generation completes THEN the system SHALL provide playback controls for the generated music
6. IF generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and suggest alternative parameters

### Requirement 3: Interactive Parameter Controls

**User Story:** As a user, I want to fine-tune my creations with visual controls, so that I can perfect my artistic output without rewriting descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adjusts mood sliders THEN the system SHALL update generation parameters in real-time
2. WHEN the user modifies style controls THEN the system SHALL regenerate visual output instantly
3. WHEN the user changes tempo or instrument settings THEN the system SHALL update audio output without interruption
4. WHEN the user adjusts color palette controls THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in the visual output immediately
5. WHEN any parameter changes THEN the system SHALL maintain generation continuity without page reloads
6. WHEN the user resets controls THEN the system SHALL return to the original parsed parameters

### Requirement 4: Community Gallery and Remix Features

**User Story:** As a creative community member, I want to browse, share, and build upon others' creations, so that I can find inspiration and collaborate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves a creation THEN the system SHALL store it with metadata including title, original spec text, and tags
2. WHEN browsing the gallery THEN the system SHALL display creations with preview thumbnails and audio samples
3. WHEN a user searches the gallery THEN the system SHALL return relevant results based on tags, titles, and descriptions
4. WHEN a user likes a creation THEN the system SHALL increment the like count and track user preferences
5. WHEN a user comments on a creation THEN the system SHALL store and display the comment with timestamp and author
6. WHEN a user selects "remix" on a creation THEN the system SHALL duplicate the original spec with editable parameters
7. WHEN the gallery has 1000+ concurrent users THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth browsing performance

### Requirement 5: Export and Integration Capabilities

**User Story:** As a professional creative, I want to export my AI-generated content in standard formats, so that I can use them in my existing creative workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests image export THEN the system SHALL provide high-fidelity PNG and GIF format options
2. WHEN a user requests video export THEN the system SHALL generate MP4 files with appropriate resolution and quality
3. WHEN a user requests audio export THEN the system SHALL provide MP3 and WAV format options with professional quality
4. WHEN export is requested THEN the system SHALL process and deliver the file within 10 seconds for standard formats
5. WHEN external tools request integration THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints for accessing creation data
6. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted responses with creation metadata and download links

### Requirement 6: User Onboarding and Learning

**User Story:** As a new user, I want clear guidance on how to use the platform effectively, so that I can create compelling content from my first session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user first accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL present an interactive onboarding flow
2. WHEN onboarding begins THEN the system SHALL demonstrate effective spec writing with examples
3. WHEN users need inspiration THEN the system SHALL provide a sample spec library with diverse examples
4. WHEN users view examples THEN the system SHALL show both the input spec and the expected output
5. WHEN onboarding completes THEN the system SHALL provide easy access to help documentation and tutorials
6. WHEN users struggle with spec writing THEN the system SHALL offer contextual tips and suggestions
